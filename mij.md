**SuperDrBacon**: .,ai Github wants me to make a personal bio for my profile.

> **_BOT_ David Marcus**: I'm a software engineer who loves coding, learning new technologies, and trying new things. I like to do things that challenge myself and push the envelope. I have experience with a variety of languages and frameworks, and I'm always looking to learn more. When I'm not coding or learning, I enjoy the gym and spending time with my family.
